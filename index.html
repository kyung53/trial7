            <p class="par">Happy 15th birthday, my love! I hope you enjoy this day surrounded by your loved ones. I just want to tell you how much I love you, lovey, and wish for all your dreams to come true. Though we may be facing a rough patch right now, I hope we can overcome it together and continue this journey side by side. I envision celebrating many more birthdays together, whether as lovers or not, and I promise to be by your side no matter what. Even though we can't predict the future, I want us to dream together and achieve our goals as a team. I hope to be there to congratulate you at every step, offering my unconditional love and support until the end. Despite uncertainties, I am committed to being your one-call-away person, ready to boost your self-esteem whenever you need it. When doubts or problems arise, don't hesitate to share them with me. I won't judge; I'm here to listen, comfort, or provide advice, even if I'm not the best at it. Remember, every time you feel like no one believes in you, I believe in you. I am always here to support you, and you can count on me. Happy birthday, lovey! 🎉🎂</p>
